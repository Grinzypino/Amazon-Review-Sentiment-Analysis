# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

In today's digital age, we encounter numerous products daily, especially when browsing online, where hundreds of options under a single category are just a swipe away. This abundance of choices can make decision-making overwhelming for customers. To address this, product reviews play a crucial role. Customers who have purchased and used a product often provide ratings and share their experiences through written reviews. While ratings offer a quick way to evaluate a productâ€™s quality, analyzing written reviews requires more effort, as each review must be read and interpreted to determine whether it conveys a positive or negative sentiment. 

Marketplace websites like Amazon receive a significant volume of user feedback, making it challenging to review and analyze all inputs manually. To streamline this process, feedback needs to be categorized based on the opinions expressed in forums. This categorization can be integrated into a feedback management system to enhance its efficiency. By classifying individual comments and reviews and determining overall ratings from them, companies can gain a comprehensive understanding of customer feedback. This insight enables businesses to address specific areas of concern, fostering customer loyalty and driving improvements in business performance, brand reputation, and profitability.
